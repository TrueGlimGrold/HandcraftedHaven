# Project Task Breakdown

This document outlines the tasks assigned to each team member for the project. The tasks are divided into categories based on responsibilities.

## **Validation & Error Handling (Arnold)**

1. Implement a 404 (Not Found) error page for invalid routes or resources.
2. Create a 500 (Internal Server Error) page to handle server-side errors gracefully.
3. Develop a 400 (Bad Request) error handler for invalid client requests.
4. Set up middleware for server-side validation of incoming requests (e.g., checking for required fields, data types, etc.).
5. Implement client-side validation for forms and inputs to prevent invalid data submission.
6. Write unit tests for error handling and validation logic to ensure robustness.

## **Data Schema (Arnold)**

7. Define and document the data schema for the application (e.g., fields, data types, relationships).
8. Validate data against the schema before saving it to the database.

## **Database & CRUD (Luke)**

9. Set up the database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and configure the connection.
10. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `Products` collection/table.
11. Write database queries and ensure they are optimized for performance.
12. Create scripts for database seeding and migrations.

---

## **Products (Luke)**

13. Design the database schema for the `Products` entity (e.g., name, price, description, etc.).
14. Develop API endpoints for managing products (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
15. Implement search and filtering functionality for products.

## **Theme and CSS (Henry)**

16. Design and implement a consistent theme for the application (e.g., color scheme, typography).
17. Create reusable CSS components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals) for the front end.
18. Ensure the application is responsive and works seamlessly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
19. Style error pages (404, 500, 400) to match the applicationâ€™s theme.

## **User Stories & Login (Elisa)**

20. Write detailed user stories for all features (e.g., login, product management, error handling).
21. Implement user authentication and login functionality (e.g., using JWT or OAuth).
22. Create user roles and permissions (e.g., admin, customer) and enforce them across the application.
23. Develop a user registration flow with validation and error handling.

---

## **ENV File & Configuration (Elisa)**

24. Set up the `.env` file to store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
25. Ensure environment variables are properly loaded and used in the application.

---

## **General Tasks**

26. Conduct code reviews and ensure all tasks are integrated smoothly.
27. Write documentation for the application, including setup instructions and API usage.
28. Perform end-to-end testing to ensure all features work as expected.

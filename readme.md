Task 5: Implement client-side validation for forms and inputs to prevent invalid data submission.

Task 6: Write unit tests for error handling and validation logic to ensure robustness.

Task 8: Validate data against the schema before saving it to the database.

Database & CRUD (Luke)
Task 9: Set up the database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) and configure the connection.

Task 10: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Products collection/table.

Task 11: Write database queries and ensure they are optimized for performance.

Task 12: Create scripts for database seeding and migrations.

Products (Luke)
Task 13: Design the database schema for the Products entity (e.g., name, price, description, etc.).

Task 14: Develop API endpoints for managing products (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Task 15: Implement search and filtering functionality for products.

Theme and CSS (Henry)
Task 16: Design and implement a consistent theme for the application (e.g., color scheme, typography).

Task 17: Create reusable CSS components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals) for the front end.

Task 18: Ensure the application is responsive and works seamlessly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Task 19: Style error pages (404, 500, 400) to match the applicationâ€™s theme.

User Stories & Login (Elisa)
Task 20: Write detailed user stories for all features (e.g., login, product management, error handling).

Task 21: Implement user authentication and login functionality (e.g., using JWT or OAuth).

Task 22: Create user roles and permissions (e.g., admin, customer) and enforce them across the application.

Task 23: Develop a user registration flow with validation and error handling.

ENV File & Configuration (Elisa)
Task 24: Set up the .env file to store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

Task 25: Ensure environment variables are properly loaded and used in the application.
